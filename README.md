# Fabrication of the custom parts for the three-chamber sociability arena

This is a list of components that need to be fabricated (laser-cut) from the 6 mm thick PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheets:
- long outer wall (2x)
- short outer wall (2x)
- chamber separation wall (4x)
- outer part of the door (2 per door, 4x in total)
- separation reinforcement wall (2x)

This is a list of components that need to be fabricated (laser-cut) from the 8 mm thick PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet:
- inner part of the door (1 per door, 2x in total)

This is a list of components that need to be fabricated (laser-cut) from the 3 mm thick PLEXIGLAS® Clear sheet:
- corner compartment walls (4x)
- corner compartment holders (8x; byproduct of the open interaction slots in the corner compartment walls)

## Arranging of the sketches

We use an [OMTech laser cutter](https://de.omtech.com/products/100w-co2-laser-graviermaschine-cutter-mit-100x-60cm-bearbeitungsflache-autofokus-max-gr10) with an engraving area of 1000 x 600 mm. The size of the PLEXIGLAS® sheets listed above ([Commercially available and custom-made parts](#commercially-available-and-custom-made-parts)) has been calculated to fit as many components on one sheet as possible while still maintaining a minimum clearance of 1 cm from all edges and adjacent components. See the images below on how we arranged the sketches (DXF files) in RDWorks.

Both long outer walls (700 x 450 x 6 mm PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet):

Both short outer walls and two of four chamber separation walls (750 x 450 x 6 mm PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet):

Remaining two chamber separation walls and all four outer parts of the doors (750 x 450 x 6 mm PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet):

Both separtion reinforcement walls (600 x 250 x 6 mm PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet):

Both inner parts of the doors (400 x 300 x 8 mm PLEXIGLAS® Satinice sheet):

All four corner compartment walls ( x  x 3 mm PLEXIGLAS® Clear sheet); yields the needed eight corner compartment holders:
